i want to create a space on the left side for displaying a video. its a video size of width 1920 and height 1080. you may adjust the side so to make it fit in the website. i dont want the entire website fill by the video.

I'll help you add a video section on the left side while maintaining the existing layout. I'll adjust the content layout and add appropriate sizing for the video container.


Updated Artist Portfolio with Video Section
Click to open code
I've made the following changes to accommodate the video:

Added a new video-container div on the left side of the content
Modified the content layout to use space-between for proper spacing
Set the video container to take up 60% of the width using max-width: 60%
Maintained the aspect ratio of 16:9 using aspect-ratio: 16/9
Added responsive styling for smaller screens
Adjusted the artist description width to 35% of the space
Added proper spacing between video and text using gap: 20px
To use this:

Replace your-video.mp4 with your actual video file name
The video will maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the container
Controls are enabled by default for play/pause/volume
On mobile devices, it will stack the video above the text
Would you like me to adjust any of these proportions or make other changes to the layout?

make sure video will stay of the center of the left side, and also fllow moving down if user roll down the page


I'll modify the video container to stay centered on the left side and follow the scroll behavior you want.


Updated Artist Portfolio with Fixed-Position Video
Click to open code
Key changes made:

Created a new video-wrapper that's fixed positioned on the left side
Added centering for the video both horizontally and vertically within its container
Set a max-width for the video container to prevent it from getting too large
Adjusted the artist description to have a left margin that matches the video width
Updated the responsive design to stack properly on mobile devices
Maintained proper spacing below the header for both the video and content
Kept the video centered in its container while scrolling
The video will now:

Stay fixed on the left side while scrolling
Remain centered vertically in its container
Maintain its aspect ratio
Be responsive on mobile devices
Have proper spacing from the header
Would you like me to adjust any of these aspects or make other changes to the layout?

few issues to be fix, first the video does appear on the website but you cant play it. second, make sure the white space on the left and right side of the video are equal.


I'll fix the video playback issue and ensure the video is properly centered with equal spacing on both sides.


Updated Artist Portfolio with Centered Video
Click to open code
Key fixes made:

Fixed video playback issues:
Added pointer-events: none to the wrapper and pointer-events: auto to the video container
Added preload="metadata" and playsinline attributes to the video tag
Changed object-fit: cover to object-fit: contain to ensure the video displays properly
Improved video centering:
Removed horizontal padding from the video wrapper
Set a more specific max-width (800px) for the video container
Added margin: 0 auto to ensure equal spacing
Added black background to ensure visibility during video load
These changes should:

Make the video controls fully functional
Ensure equal spacing on both sides of the video
Maintain proper centering while scrolling
Work properly on all devices

I'll modify the code to center the video vertically on the left side and make it follow the scroll while maintaining equal spacing.

You're right - let's go back to the first version's video implementation that was working correctly, but keep the positioning adjustments we made.

for the video part , use this instead <div class="content"> <div class="video-container"> <video controls> <source src="your-video.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> </div>

I'll help you replace the video implementation with the one you provided while maintaining the positioning and sizing we want.

        <video controls>
            <source src="your-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">

            <h2>Info</h2>
            
            <p>If you'd like to explore my work, feel free to visit my website. I designed it to let users fully express their creativity, encouraging them to create using simple lines and shapes.</p>
            
            <p>Here's a little bit about me:</p>
            
            <p>I'm currently a student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computational Art. My passion for traditional oil painting began when I was a kid. Not only did I enjoy creating them, but I also found joy in observing them. Every time I visit a museum and look at these masterpieces, I marvel at how they've endured over time and still captivate viewers. Despite the years that have passed, these works continue to connect with audiences. This has always made me wonder: How can I create something aesthetically pleasing while telling a story that represents me—without worrying about whether viewers will like it or not.</p>
            
            <p>As I've grown, I've discovered immersive art—an art form that creates a multisensory environment, inviting visitors to explore and interact with the space. Unlike traditional art, which you simply observe, immersive installations engage multiple senses, allowing for a deeper experience. The media used to create these works also reflect the era we live in—the evolution of technology. Just as tempera paints represented the Middle Ages and Renaissance, or oil pigments marked later periods, I believe that technology is the medium that defines our time. It has the power to transform the impossible into the possible, providing endless space for artistic exploration.</p>
            
            <p>As an artist, I love experimenting with different media, especially blending traditional elements with new technologies. My work often interacts with space, light, sound, and other traditional media. I'm still in the process of discovering new ways to create immersive experiences.</p>
